			<h1>Avraham Netanel Yaakov</h1> 
			<h2>Aspiring creator of songs and drawings</h2>
			<p>For years I have kept my work hidden from the public eye. Now that I get into web design I've decided to bring some of it out.
			This website is the first website I've designed and an ongoing expiriment.
			Feel free to read and view my songs and drawings. If you've enjoyed them tell your friends so that they can enjoy them as well.</p>

			<h3>Songs</h3>
			<p>I have written my first song at the age of 11 and it was pretty profane. Since then I've written less childish songs in both hebrew and english. Hopefully you will find them good (or better).</p>

			<h3>Drawings</h3>
			<p>I have been drawing for as long as I can remember. It is a passion I keep coming back to from time to time (If I have any). A selection of them are here for your enjoyment.</p>
